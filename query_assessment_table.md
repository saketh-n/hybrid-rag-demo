| Query | Response (Excerpt) | Test Pass or Fail | Failure Type | Analysis (Why Occurred) | Potential Resolution |
|-------|--------------------|-------------------|--------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| 'Explain collision avoidance in robotic arms' | Collision avoidance in robotic arms involves the use of sensors to detect obstacles within a specified radius... | Pass | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| 'What are the key safety standards mentioned?' | The key safety standards mentioned are ISO 10218-1... and ISO 13849-1... | Fail | Incomplete | Semantic routing retrieves top-matching nodes with frequent mentions, but top_k=3 limits scope; LLM interprets "key" as primary, omitting scattered standards. Debatable if "key" implies selective. | Increase top_k to 5; rewrite query for exhaustiveness; add reranker for diversity. |
| 'Summarize section 2' | Section 2 outlines the safety requirements for the XR-200 robotic arm... | Pass | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| 'Tell me about testing in section 4' | Testing procedures in section 4 include functional tests... | Pass | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| 'Summarize section 6' | Section 6 is not provided in the context information. | Pass | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| 'What is in section 10?' | There is no information provided about Section 10 in the context. | Pass | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| 'Give a detailed explanation of Section 3 design' | The design of Section 3 includes a 6-axis robotic arm... | Pass | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| 'summarize Section 2 on safety' | Section 2 outlines safety requirements for the XR-200 robotic arm... | Pass | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| 'Summarize section abc' | Summarize section 4: Testing and Validation. | Fail | Hallucination | Explicit routing detects "section" but invalid "abc" fails regex, fallback to semantic; vector matches to similar headers (e.g., Section 4); LLM over-interprets. | Detect invalid numbers in retriever, return "invalid" message; refine fallback prompt; stricter router description. |
| 'What is the report about?' | The report is about the safety compliance process for the XR-200... | Pass | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| '' (empty) | Skipped or handle as needed | Pass | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| 'section' | The section mentioned... is related to the compliance report... | Fail | Vague hallucination | Explicit routing on "section", no number fails regex, fallback to semantic; pulls broad nodes; LLM generates unhelpful summary. | Handle incomplete explicit in retriever/router with "specify number"; add clarification prompt.  |
