# Compliance Report: Industrial Robotic Arm Safety Certification

## Section 1: Introduction
This report outlines the safety compliance process for the XR-200 Industrial Robotic Arm, designed for automated manufacturing. The arm must meet standards such as ISO 10218-1 (Robotics Safety) and ISO 13849-1 (Safety of Machinery) to ensure safe operation alongside human workers. Key objectives include validating electrical, mechanical, and software requirements to achieve certification and enable market entry.

## Section 2: Safety Requirements
The XR-200 must comply with ISO 10218-1, which mandates:
- **Emergency Stop**: The arm must halt within 0.5 seconds of an emergency stop trigger.
- **Collision Avoidance**: Sensors must detect obstacles within a 1-meter radius and adjust motion to prevent collisions.
- **Electrical Safety**: No risk of shock when the arm is touched during operation, per IEC 61508 standards.
These requirements are linked to design specifications and validated through testing.

## Section 3: Design and Implementation
The robotic arm’s architecture includes:
- **Mechanical Design**: A 6-axis arm with a maximum payload of 10 kg, designed for precision tasks.
- **Software Controls**: Real-time control algorithms ensure smooth operation and compliance with safety protocols.
- **Traceability**: All design decisions are documented to maintain compliance with ISO 26262 and ISO 12100, ensuring traceability from requirements to implementation.

## Section 4: Testing and Validation
Testing procedures include:
- **Functional Tests**: Verify emergency stop and collision avoidance under ISO 10218-1.
- **Stress Tests**: Assess arm performance under maximum load conditions.
- **Audit Trails**: Automated reports generated to document compliance with ISO 13849-1, reducing certification time.
Validation confirms that the XR-200 meets all regulatory standards, with results stored in a centralized platform.

## Section 5: Certification and Next Steps
The XR-200 is on track for ISO 10218-1 and UL certification, with Saphira AI’s platform streamlining report generation by 50%. Next steps include submitting documentation to regulatory bodies and addressing any identified gaps.[](https://www.saphira.ai/blog/saphira-ai-accelerates-iso-10218-1-compliance-for-robco)
